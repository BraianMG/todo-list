# __ToDo List__ (Documentation)

I decided to manage both the client and the server in different repositories to facilitate the deployments in HEROKU, the respective repositories are:
- __Frontend__: [https://github.com/BraianMG/todo-list-frontend](https://github.com/BraianMG/todo-list-frontend)
- __Backend__: [https://github.com/BraianMG/todo-list-backend](https://github.com/BraianMG/todo-list-backend)

You can use and test the deployment at __[https://braianmg-todo-list.herokuapp.com/](https://braianmg-todo-list.herokuapp.com/)__

## __Comments__
I reached a result with which I am not entirely satisfied, with a little more time I could make some improvements and add tests for both the frontend and the backend, even deploy it in, for example, Heroku
The truth is that I really liked this challenge, it made me discover some specific points to improve, so I will not hesitate to strengthen those areas, I plan to continue with this project and improve it day by day.
